	abstract = {We report the results of a spectroscopic study of the Boötes III (BooIII) stellar overdensity carried out with the Hectospec multifiber spectrograph on the MMT telescope. Radial velocities have been measured for 193 BooIII candidate stars selected to have magnitudes and colors consistent with its upper main sequence and lower red giant branch, as well as a number of horizontal-branch candidates. From 20 identified candidate BooIII members, we measure a systemic velocity of V☉ = 197.5 ± 3.8 km s−1 and a velocity dispersion of σo = 14.0 ± 3.2 km s−1. We use the somewhat large velocity dispersion and the implied highly radial orbit, along with morphological evidence from Grillmair and stellar abundances, to argue that BooIII is likely the first known object observed in a transitional state between being a bound dwarf galaxy and a completely unbound tidal stream.}

	abstract = {ABSTRACT We report on the detection of a population of Red Clump (RC) stars probably associated with the recently discovered stellar system Boötes III. The RC is identified as a 3σ peak in the luminosity function (LF) of colour-selected stars extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data base. The peak is consistently detected in the g, r, i and z LFs at the expected luminosity of a typical RC at the distance of Boötes III. Moreover, the stars around the LF peak show a maximum of surface density nearly coincident with the reported centre of the system. Assuming that the detected feature is the genuine RC of Boötes III, we find that the system has the horizontal branch morphology typical of old and metal-poor dwarf spheroidals, it has an integrated magnitude MV≃−5.8 ± 0.5 and an ellipticity ε∼ 0.5, quite typical of the recently identified new class of very faint dwarf galaxies.},

	abstract = {We present proper motion (PM) measurements of Boötes III, an enigmatic stellar satellite of the Milky Way (MW), utilizing data from the second data release of the Gaia mission. By selecting 15 radial velocity confirmed members of Boötes III, along with a likely RR Lyrae member in the vicinity, we measure an error-weighted mean PM of (μα , μδ) = (−1.14, −0.98) ± (0.18, 0.20) mas yr−1. We select and present further stars that may be Boötes III members based on their combined PM and position in the color–magnitude diagram. We caution against assigning membership to stars that are not confirmed spectroscopically, as we demonstrate that there are contaminating stars from the disrupting globular cluster NGC 5466 in the vicinity of the main body of Boötes III, but we note that our results are consistent with previous Boötes III PM estimates that did not include spectroscopic members. Based on the measured PM and other known properties of Boötes III, we derive its Galactocentric velocity and compute its orbit given canonical MW potentials with halo masses of both 0.8 × 1012 M⊙ and 1.6 × 1012 M⊙. These orbits robustly show that Boötes III passed within ∼12 kpc of the Galactic center on an eccentric orbit roughly ∼140 Myr ago. Additionally, the PM of Boötes III is in excellent agreement with predictions for the retrograde motion of the coincident Styx stellar stream. Given this, along with the small pericenter and metallicity spread of Boötes III itself, we suggest that it is a disrupting dwarf galaxy giving rise to the Styx stellar stream.}
